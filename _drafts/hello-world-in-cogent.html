<p>This post talks about writing a "Hello, World" program in Cogent. The goal behind this exercise is two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>to give the reader a peek into writing a program in Cogent</li>
<li>and to give an overview of the different parts of a Cogent program<br />
and how they fit together</li>
</ul>
<p>Before proceeding further, make sure that the Cogent compiler is built and installed.  Please follow instructions <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/cogent/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/cogent/blob/master/cogent/INSTALL.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to build the Cogent compiler.</p>
<p>So let's get started!</p>
<p>Cogent compiler has several <a href="http://ts.data61.csiro.au/images/cogent-overview.png">phases</a>, and one of the last things it does is generate C code(from the Cogent code) and invoke a C compiler, to build an ELF object(executable or a kernel module as dictated by the project build rules). Essentially, the Cogent compiler is tightly coupled with a C compiler.<br />
Cogent relies on C code for entry and exit into a program(or a kernel module). Typically a Cogent project will have a C file(or in some cases an anti-quoted C file) along with Cogent code. The C file has the entry function into the program (<code>main()</code> for an executable and <code>module_init()</code> in the case of a Linux kernel module), which can invoke Cogent functions directly(if <code>main()</code> or <code>module_init()</code> are in a <code>.ac</code> file) or indirectly(if <code>main()</code> or <code>module_init()</code> are in a <code>.c</code> file). We will see shortly, the difference between a <code>main.c</code> and a <code>main.ac</code> file.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Structure of Cogent project</strong></span></p>
<p>A Cogent 'project' in its simplest of forms has the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>one or more Cogent source files (Cogent source files have a <em>.cogent</em> extension)</li>
<li>one or more anti-quoted C source files(anti-quoted C source files have <em>.ac</em> extension)</li>
<li>A text file listing all the Cogent functions, each separated by a newline, that are called from anti-quoted C source files.</li>
<li>an optional(but highly recommended) <em>Makefile</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So at the bare minimum, there are 4 files in a Cogent project.  Let us now see how this maps to the "Hello, World!" project we are about to implement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Cogent idiosyncrasies</strong></span></p>
<p>There are a few idiosyncrasies that one needs to get used to when writing Cogent code. I like to highlight these two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cogent source files cannot be empty. The Cogent compiler just doesn't like it.</li>
<li>All functions in Cogent take only one argument. This is true of most functional languages(read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currying</a>), but this needs a bit of getting used to.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Hello, World!</strong></span></p>
<p>We will create 4 empty files in our project:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Makefile</em></li>
<li><em>main.ac</em></li>
<li><em>HelloWorld.cogent</em></li>
<li><em>entrypoints.cfg</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For now, use <a href="https://gist.github.com/ajaysusarla/0502bad26f5b4bfa1c08829b98618e31#file-makefile">this</a> as the template for the Makefile. The source file names could be anything, just make sure that the Makefile reflects those names.</p>
