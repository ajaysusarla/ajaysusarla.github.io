<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> passed away.</p>
<p>It is indeed a sad day.</p>
<p>I started using computers when in university (I was 18 then). And in the last 14 years, I have been using both C and Unix (and its variants, Linux mostly). And if I look around, most of the devices that I have, including but not limited to, my laptop, my phone, my desktop at work, use C and Unix (Linux in this case). I earn my &#039;daily-bread&#039; as a C programmer, I have enjoyed being a C programmer. I just love the flexibility that it provides and its sheer simplicity. I&#039;ve _always_ had a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1318559159&amp;sr=8-1">The C programming language</a> with me. And that is the book that I always keep going back to, between jobs (for interviews) and occasional reference.</p>
<p>I owe it to Dennis Ritchie big time.</p>
<p>My heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. May his soul rest in peace.</p>
