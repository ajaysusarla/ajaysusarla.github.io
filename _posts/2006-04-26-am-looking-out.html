<p>Hiya people,<br />
So i have thought about this way too much and have decided to search for another job. I have been on the look out since a couple of months - and have a few job offers in hand, but none that is motivating/interesting enough.<br />
So if you guys know of any company that his hiring Linux Application/System developers please do let me know. I have close to 4 years experience(2 months short of 4 years). Am a gnome-hacker. And i primarily work in C. (Open to working in C++ too). Currently employed at Novell.</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance</p>
