<p>My trusted Thinkpad X220, started behaving erratically with random segfaults. Initially the segfaults very sparse, happening occasionally. But it wasn't long before it was completely unusable.</p>
<p><a href="https://sparthadotorg2.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_20141026_184825.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-404 alignleft" src="https://sparthadotorg2.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_20141026_184825.jpg" alt="IMG_20141026_184825" width="300" height="225" /></a>I initially suspected an update of the OS might have something to do with it. But I soon realised that it was a memory issue. The image on the left shows my laptop running the Memtest86+, with a *lot* of reds.</p>
<p>Work has been really busy and I haven't had the time to get a replacement RAM module. I have been without my laptop for a month now, Intend to fix my laptop this week, and while I'm on it, planning to upgrade to SSD as well. After some research, I have decided to buy a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/au/consumer/pc-peripherals/solid-state-drive/ssd-840-evo/MZ-7TE500BW">Samsung 840 EVO SSD (500GB)</a> and a <a href="http://www.cx.com.au/catalog/computer-hardware/memory/laptop-memory/corsair-8gb-(1x8gb)-ddr3-1600mhz-11-11-11-28-unbuffered-cl11-sodimm/c24/c278/p18704">Corsair 8G RAM</a> module.</p>
<p>Upgrading to an SSD means that I need to reinstall. And that means that I will be without a functional laptop for a couple of weeks more.</p>
