<p>just a couple of days more to go and its time for foss.in - all the talks - all the drooling at the speakers... Man am excited or what.</p>
<p>Meanwhile...</p>
<p>My marriage is less than 3 weeks away - and i have been really busy with it. Just finished with the invites. Got them from the printer last evening.  Loaded with work at work too. </p>
<p>All the best to the team (http://foss.in/2006/info/Team) at foss.in.</p>
<p>C you guys there.</p>
