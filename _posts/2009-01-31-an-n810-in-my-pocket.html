<p>Last week, i got something that i take great pleasure in owning. A <a href="http://www.nseries.com/products/n810/">Nokia N 810 Internet Tablet</a>. I have seen them with the <a href="http://foss.in/about/team">foss.in team</a> earlier, and now i finally have one of my own. And it really feels great. <br /><a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/jus4kix/pic/000066qa/"><img alt="Me and my n810" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/s320x240" width="320" height="214" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>First, i should really thank <a href="http://foss.in/about/team">Foss.in team</a> and of-course those guys at <a href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a> who have been so kind to give out such amazing stuff. And <a href="http://shres.in">shreyas</a>, thanks a ton dude. I owe it to you.</p>
<p>The N810 runs Linux (on ARM) - and has quite impressive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810">specs</a>. It works quite well mostly, except for a few glitches here and there, specially with the GPS stuff. And it has the camel libs for its <a href="http://tinymail.org/">tinymail</a> client. IÂ have done a lot of work on the <a href="http://www.go-evolution.org/index.php/Camel">Camel Libs</a> for <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/">Evolution</a>, and<a href="http://pvanhoof.be/blog/"> Philip Van Hoof</a> has made significant changes for camel to work efficiently on a mobile device.</p>
<p>I'm spending sleepless nights, trying to get stuff built and running (using the Maemo SDK). And its been fun so far. I hope to make some significant contributions to the <a href="http://maemo.org/intro/">Maemo</a> platform. Will keep my log updated with whatever i do.</p>
