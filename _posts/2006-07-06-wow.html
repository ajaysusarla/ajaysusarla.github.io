<p>It had been sometime since i built the kernel snapshots and I was just building the latest kernel (2.6.17.3) and notice something new. A new system call called the kexec. More info here: http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/README</p>
<p>This is such amazing stuff - its a big step towards making virtualisation defacto in linux.</p>
