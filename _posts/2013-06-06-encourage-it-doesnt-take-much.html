<p>A very interesting opinion from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnston_%28drummer%29" target="_blank">Mike Johnston </a> :</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa5JsiMe6Qc</p>
<p>A bit of encouragement or constructive criticism, goes a long way. I've had personal experiences where I  have once been at the receiving end of very negative criticism for various reasons in the open source project that i contribute to. And such incident(s) does impact ones self-confidence. Being sensitive to others feelings, tolerance and words of encouragement do make a lot of difference.</p>
<p><a href="http://shres.in/" target="_blank">Somebody</a> once told me, If you have nothing good to say, then don't say anything.  And I can't help but agree.</p>
