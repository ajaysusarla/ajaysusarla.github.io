<p>So finally it happens, i have a blog page now, like millions of those people all round the world, who type their way to glory. Am really not sure why people blog, and i really dont care much at the moment, since am a part of this blogging 'fraternity'.</p>
<p>I owe it to &nbsp; &amp; &nbsp; for they are the guys who actually got me into this. (Am sorry if i my tone does not sound thankful!).</p>
<p>I welcome myself to the vast world of Weblog!</p>
<p>Cheerio.<br />P.S: This thing might not look good. Am still finding my way thru this thing. Should look good soon, if i dont give up that is.</p>
