<p>Earlier this morning, my laptop (a Lenovo Thinkpad X220) refused to wake up from suspend. And afer a hard reset, my machine refused to boot with the following messages on the console:</p>
<p><code><br />
BUG: soft lockup = CPU#1 stuck for 22s! [which:604]<br />
hda_codec: rates == 0 (ni=0x10, val=0x0, ovrd=1)<br />
hda_codec: cannot attach PCM stream 0 for codec #0<br />
INFO: rcu_preempt detected stalls on CPUs/tasks: { 0}<br />
</code></p>
<p>Rebooting the machine again didn't help,It was the same error again, but this time around it was systemd and systemd-udev causing the lockup. Pretty clueless and with no access to the interwebs I was at least hoping to get a stack trace of some sort. There were none.</p>
<p>My first (and the most obvious) suspect was the kernel and drivers. I had a quick look at my <em>grub.cfg</em>, part of which is shown here:</p>
<p><code><br />
menuentry 'Arch Linux Linux, with Linux core repo kernel' --class arch --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-core repo kernel-true-7cb6bd41-b198-4d1d-8ae4-fc8f169abb00' {<br />
load_video<br />
set gfxpayload=keep<br />
insmod gzio<br />
insmod part_gpt<br />
insmod ext2<br />
set root='hd0,gpt3'<br />
if [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then<br />
search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,gpt3 --hint-efi=hd0,gpt3 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,gpt3  7cb6bd41-b198-4d1d-8ae4-fc8f169abb00<br />
else<br />
search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 7cb6bd41-b198-4d1d-8ae4-fc8f169abb00<br />
fi<br />
echo    'Loading Linux core repo kernel ...'<br />
linux    /boot/vmlinuz-linux root=UUID=7cb6bd41-b198-4d1d-8ae4-fc8f169abb00 ro root=/dev/sda3 ro fastboot splash=silent quiet threadirqs add_efi_memmap pcie_aspm=force i915.i915_enable_rc6=7 i915.i915_enable_fbc=1 i915.lvds_downclock=1 rootfstype=ext4 init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd<br />
echo    'Loading initial ramdisk ...'<br />
initrd    /boot/initramfs-linux.img<br />
}<br />
</code></p>
<p>I decided to cut down all the cruft and see if I can get the machine up and running. Switching to the grub command-line, i did the following(remember TAB completion is your friend):</p>
<p><code><br />
insmod part_gpt<br />
insmod ext2<br />
set root=(hd0,gpt3)<br />
linux /boot/vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda3 rootfstype=ext4<br />
initrd /boot/initramfs-linux.img<br />
boot<br />
</code></p>
<p>Thankfully, That worked!</p>
<p>With my machine back in action. The next step was to look through the kernel docs. And I found this about soft lockups:</p>
<blockquote><p>A 'softlockup' is defined as a bug that causes the kernel to loop in<br />
kernel mode for more than 20 seconds (see "Implementation" below for<br />
details), without giving other tasks a chance to run.</p></blockquote>
<p>More about it <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/lockup-watchdogs.txt">here</a>. There is even a command line parameter, <em>softlockup_panic</em> (search for it in <a href="//www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt">kernel parameters</a> doc) that will help generate the much needed stack trace.</p>
<p>This problem is clearly system specific. Some combination of the kernel alongwith drivers and/or firmware messes around with usage of the cpu. In my case it is one of the following parameters:</p>
<pre>* threadirqs
* add_efi_memmap
* pcie_aspm=force
* i915 and family</pre>
<p>I had a personal committment to get to, so didn't probe this issue any further, will get to it during the weekend. For now, I thought I should share it, in case someone else might find this information helpful and also has some pointers on what caused the problem.</p>
<p>I am currently running <em>3.13.2-1-ARCH</em> kernel and <em>xf86-video-intel 2.99.910-1</em> drivers. The machine has an <em>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2520M CPU @ 2.50GHz</em> and the following PCI hardware:</p>
