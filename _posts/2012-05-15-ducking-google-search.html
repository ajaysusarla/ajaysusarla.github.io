<p><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> is an awesome company. I like a <a href="http://code.google.com/">few</a> <a href="http://www.android.com/">things</a> <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">they</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">do</a>. I especially liked their now defunct,<a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch"> google code search</a>, which was extremely helpful for looking up code, instead of having to download source.<br />There are a few things that i totally dislike in the newer google search interface though. As much as it has retained its simplicity, in look and feel, there is a lot that happens now. For instance, the automatic suggestions, which i am not a big fan of and in fact find it a little annoying at times. Another being, search results spread across multiple pages. In most cases, anything that is not shown in the first page is mostly ignored.</p>
<p>After chance encounter with <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">duckduckgo</a> and evaluating it for a while, i liked the way duckduckgo worked. And a couple of months ago, i moved to using it full time. It is now my default search engine in firefox (Download it <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-ssl/">here</a>).<br />&quot;duckduckgo&quot; is surely a intriguing name for a search engine (or anything else for that matter), and thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikipedia</a> i found out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Duck_Go#History">why</a>. With its simple interface, the duck with an attitude logo, the dynamically growing page displaying search results is surely worth a try. The only thing i miss though is the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/#hl=en&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;pq=the%20answe&amp;cp=10&amp;gs_id=9t&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=the+answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=the+answer&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g4&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=2dafc0a84b7f206c&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1059">uncanny sense of humour</a>.</p>
<p>So if you think DuckDuckGo is something that you might like, I suggest that go ahead and give it a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">shot</a>.</p>
