<p>I came across an interesting and a very informational <a href="http://www.koch.ro/blog/index.php?/archives/153-On-distributing-binaries.html">post</a> by <a href="http://www.koch.ro/blog/">Thomas Koch</a> while reading <a href="http://planet.debian.org/">planet.debian.org.</a> And I really believe that this has to be talked about a lot more, Primarily to create awareness among novice (and seasoned) users of FOSS.</p>
<p>It is a common practice with most of us to download source tarballs and binary packages from all over the interweb. Although few of the seasoned/experienced users among the FOSS community follow the double-check-with-signatures-and-hashes process before blindly trusting the source, I think it pays to exercise caution even if it seems like paranoia. Like the age old adage &#039;it is better to be safe, than sorry&#039;,&nbsp; it is better to be over-cautious than to have our data lost and/or our identity stolen.</p>
<p>In this age of online-transactions (money and data) and ubiquitous use of wireless networks, our &#039;security&#039; is only as strong as the processes we follow to ascertain the source of the software we use or the websites we visit. A few things that i tend to follow:</p>
<p>* Install software from authorised software channels (like official repositories, whose keys/signatures are verified and trusted)<br />* if building and installing from source, make sure that the source is downloaded from authorised source repository and even then double check with signatures and MD5 hashes.<br />* And if installing from source, test before you actually install it on your primary machine (on a virtual machine)</p>
<p>Bringing about process changes are always difficult, but these changes will go a long way in protecting your system and eventually your &#039;virtual identity&#039; and data.</p>
