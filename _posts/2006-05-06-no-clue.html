<p>I have absolutely no clue what to do at work today (and its been like this since a week or so). Today is a saturday - and we are working. A compensatory working day for the day we were off during the riots. </p>
<p>I should have been really cycling today like every saturday.</p>
<p>And today Viands (the food joint i jointly own with my brother @ vidyaranyapura) completes 1 year in existance. Its been a good year. Lot of ups and downs, and a steep learning curve. Neat stuff. I wanted to spend most of my day there today.</p>
