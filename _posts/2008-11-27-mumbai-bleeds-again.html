<p>Last evening, Mumbai (and the entire nation) faced <a href="http://features.ibnlive.in.com/special/web2/mumbai-terror-attack.html">yet another Terror attack</a>. More lives lost. Much more mentally scarred, for life. Of late terrorist attacks in our country have been dangerously on the rise. So much so that there is a Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_India#Chronology_of_major_incidents">entry</a> listing the 'Chronology of the Major Events'. <br />Such incidents spread uneasiness and fear among all of us. And the obviousness of it was seen on Bangalore streets today. At around 8.30 PM, on my way back home, i noticed quite unusually the traffic, or the lack of it on the roads. People preferred to stay indoors i guess. Or maybe it was just the drizzle. <br />May the souls of the victims rest in peace. And may God give all those who had go through the traumatizing experience, strength to move on. </p>
<p>Peace. </p>
