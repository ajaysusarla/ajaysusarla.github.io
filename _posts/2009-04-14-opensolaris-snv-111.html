<p>The next scheduled release of <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org">Opensolaris</a> is 2009.06. This will be based on snv111. I just recently upgraded to <a href="http://pkg.opensolaris.org/dev">dev snapshot </a>of Opensolaris. And i should say, this release is indeed great. A lot of nitty-gritties have been taken care of.<br />* The boot-up time has considerably improved. On my Dell Precsion M4400(intel centrino 2.5Ghz, 4 Gig RAM) - it takes 40-50 seconds to boot to the GDM login screen. <br />* The shutdown is an amazing improvement since the last releases - it just takes 8-9 seconds on an average. <br />* Comes with <a href="http://gnome.org">gnome</a> 2.24 and <a href="http://www.firefox.com">firefox</a> 3.1 beta 3<br />* Lot more packages in the IPS respository (last count 33987). </p>
<p>Heres a screenshot of the Device Driver Utility (ddu) on my machine.<br /><a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/jus4kix/pic/00007bt3/"><img border="0" width="320" height="200" alt="Click to Enlarge picture" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/s320x240" /></a></p>
<p>More updates to come soon.</p>
