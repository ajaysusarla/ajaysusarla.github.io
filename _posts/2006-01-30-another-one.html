You tend to be understated and under appreciated.<br />
You have a hidden force to do amazing things, doing them your own way.<br />
People may see you as strange and shy, but they know little.<br />
Your unconventional ways have more power than they (and even you) know.</p>
<p>Your strength: Standing up for what you know is true</p>
<p>Your weakness: You tend to be picky and rigid</p>
<p>Your power color: Silver</p>
<p>Your power symbol: Square</p>
<p>Your power month: April</font></td>
