<p><a href="http://nh7.in" target="_blank">NH7</a>, my goto place to listen to my favourite artists and discover new ones, has released <a href="http://nh7intown.com/" target="_blank">NH7 in Town</a>, a brand new service to find things to do where you live. Currently only available for Mumbai, but they plan to roll out support for other cities too. Read more about it <a href="http://nh7.in/indiecision/2013/06/10/introducing-nh7-intown-find-something-to-do-in-mumbai-today/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Can't wait for them to cover Bangalore.</p>
