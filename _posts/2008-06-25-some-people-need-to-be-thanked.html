<p>Life is a mixture of good things and bad. </p>
<p>For all those who think there is not much good left in this world anymore, heres some good news. I have come across good people, people who look out for others around them and not just themselves. People who stand by others when then need support the most. <br />And call it a co-incidence, a whole lot of such good people are together at this once place, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditi_Technologies">Aditi Technologies</a> in Bangalore.</p>
<p>If you have read about Ummi's unfortunate accident <a href="http://jus4kix.livejournal.com/6625.html">here</a>, you would know what am writing about. My last post though, does not cover a lot of details regarding how Ummi got to the hospital. What i missed out in my last post goes here, a few details or the order of events might be wrong, thats because we ourselves are not aware of a lot of things. And there are too many people involved. <br /><a href="void(0);/*1214387592325*/"><img height="240" border="0" width="320" alt="Ummis Bike @ the Police Station" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/s320x240" /></a><br />[ A picture of Ummis Bullet @ the police station ]</p>
<p>The first person who spotted Ummi lying on the pavement unconscious, was Manjunath, the noble soul, who jumped into action mode by first trying to get in touch with somebody who might be able to identify Ummi [ His wallet and phone were stolen by then]. Using plain common-sense and with the help of the police [ who were informed about the incident by Manjunath ] - they traced down Ummis identification and residence based on the registration number of Ummis bike. Manjunath then took Ummi to the NIMHANS hospital. Meanwhile, the cops went to Ummis place (he stays alone) - spoke to the house owner. </p>
<p>Ummi works at Aditi Technologies, more about the company <a href="http://www.aditi.com/">here</a>. And once Manjunath (and the cops) got to know that he works for Aditi, they called up Aditis' security and informed them about the accident. </p>
<p>All this happened at around 2.00 AM on sunday morning. </p>
<p>Once folks at Aditi got to know about this, all of Ummis team-mates rushed to NIMHANS.[ A word or two about NIMHANS. I have never seen such a worth-less hospital all my life, the staff and their attitude lacks any respect to human life and dignity. But more about that later.] Am glad that Ummis colleagues shared the same opinion about NIMHANS and immediately moved him to HOSMAT, where he is currently being treated.</p>
<p>What the guys at Aditi did was indeed praise-worthy. A few names i can remember of-hand Manas, Chethan P, Chethan S, Deepak..... the list just goes on. I am sorry that i dont remember most of the other names. And the list includes his team-mates, his manager, the HR manager, the GM and a whole lot of others who rushed to the hospital and stood by him and all of his friends. Their presence of mind and their selflessness assured me that there are good people in this world. And they are right among us. </p>
<p>Ummi is actually serving his notice period at Aditi, despite that, folks at Aditi have taken care of the insurance cover. This is indeed commendable. I am not sure how many organizations would do that. Its not surprising for a company with such moral and human values to have employees who share the same ideals. </p>
<p>Manjunath and the gang from Aditi, i bow down to you guys. Thanks a ton for your support, Ummi would not have pulled through without you guys.</p>
