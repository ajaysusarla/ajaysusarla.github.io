<p>'UP' is the new buzz word. Lately, everything has been going UPward.<br />
Fuel Prices are UP.<br />
Food Prices are UP.<br />
General Cost of Living is UP.<br />
Unemployment is UP.<br />
Consumption (of nearly everything) is UP.<br />
Salaries are *not* going UP.<br />
As a consequence, the common mans' Blood Pressure is UP.</p>
<p>I can't even imagine what else is on its way UP.</p>
<p>I hope somebody puts a full-stop to this &amp;%$* UP.</p>
