<p>I have a QNAP Turbo NAS TS410. And under a DHCP setup that is available where I live, it is difficult to figure out the IP address of my NAS box is every time I restart, since the router isn't doing a great job with the DHCP leases. The <a href="http://www.qnap.com/v3/en/product_x_down/product_down_cat.php?csn=4&amp;p_cat=1">QNAP Finder for Linux</a> that QNAP provides has strict dependencies on a specific gtk+ version. The source isn't available, making it impossible to use on my Arch Linux machine.</p>
<p>It got me wondering  though, what the app actually does. I installed the Windows version of it on a borrowed laptop and using wireshark, I figured a bunch of things, all of which I've documented <a href="https://github.com/ajaysusarla/qnap-finder/blob/master/README">here</a>. With that information, I wrote a small command-line utility that will essentially do the job for me.  I call it <em>qnap-finder</em> and it is available on <a href="https://github.com/ajaysusarla/qnap-finder">github</a>.</p>
<p>A quick preview of what the tool shows when run:</p>
<p><code><br />
$ ./qnap-finder<br />
1)<br />
Hostname    : blah<br />
IP Address  : 10.0.0.30<br />
Type           : NAS(TS-410)TS-419ITS-410<br />
</code></p>
<p>This is just the basic detail. There is a lot more information available, like the number of hard disks, the version of the firmware which I still haven't got to parsing and displaying, will get that done soon. Hopefully someone else will find this useful. And it is quite possible that I haven't done something right, so please feel free to contribute/fork or <a href="https://github.com/ajaysusarla/qnap-finder/issues">report bugs</a>.</p>

This program is a work in progress and isn't guaranteed to work with all QNAP devices.
Although this is meant to be a replacement for the Windows/Mac versions of QNAP finder,
it is not guaranteed to work that way.</pre>
