<p>It is now public, the next <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> and <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> annual developer/user conferences to be held in 2009 would be co-located.</p>
<p>I just happened to read this <a href="http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/2008-07-guadec-akademy-grancanaria.html">post</a> on the gnome-foundation-list. An excerpt from the post:</p>
<p><i>"The conferences will be separate events, but co-located and hosted by the same organizers, the Cabildo of Gran Canaria and its Secretary of Tourism, Technological Innovation and Foreign Trade."</i></p>
<p>This is a nice move, specially considering there is a strong inclination towards applications and technologies co-existing and somewhere in the distant future even sharing applications. There are good things in KDE that i want to have in GNOME. <br />And the bottom line being - the world will be a peaceful place, with one less issue to argue about.</p>
