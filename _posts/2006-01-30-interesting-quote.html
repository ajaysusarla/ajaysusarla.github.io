<p>I was reading a forward from a friend of mine who is very fond of sending forwards, since he is on the bench for too very long in a very *reputed* Software Services Firm, waiting for his turn to do something in the US of A or wherever. Anyways, i usually ignore this guys mails. But today i was really very bored. And i decided to read thru a mail titled "Intersting Quote(s)", and this is what i found:</p>
<p>"Truth of life - When everything fails, try loneliness"</p>
<p>I started wondering, what if loneliness fails too. Does this quote make sense or not?? Whoever did quote this - must have been one or all of these:<br />
* a software engineer who is on bench (cough! cough!)<br />
* another software engineer who is slogging it out at some clients office<br />
* a true psycopath<br />
* a love lorn hu(MAN)<br />
*  since it sounded so much like him when i read it first. Although i really am clueless as to what his opinion on this subject is</p>
<p>freaky world, crazy people, crazier quotes.</p>
