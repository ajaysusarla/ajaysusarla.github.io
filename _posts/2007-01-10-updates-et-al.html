<p>&nbsp;. Which was surprise since i was not really expecting them to move their butts :). Thanks guys, for making it.</p>
<p>I'm still sorting out the pictures, i shall post them asap. </p>
<p>On the work front. My new employer is a huge disappointment. I have absolutely no meaningful work. I feel totally wasted. So its that time again when i am looking out for a job which gives me something to learn, do and have fun. If any of you find any openings in your respective work places - please do let me know. My email id is ajaysusarla at gmail dot com.<br />I've been working in C on Linux primarily. But i would love to move to C++. Although am not sure if anybody would give me a job in C++ when i have not worked on it. Basically "Will do anything for Fun!". </p>
<p>Hey, I almost forgot. Wish you all a very happy new year. </p>
<p>And
