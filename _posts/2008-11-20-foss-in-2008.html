<p><a href="http://foss.in/">FOSS.IN</a> has come a long way over time. This year in its all new form, its probably going to be the best <a href="http://foss.in/">FOSS.IN</a> ever seen. The change in the way the event is going to be held only shows how mature the event has got over years. Kudos to TEAM Foss.in.<br />Incidentally, there is a promotional video from <a href="http://foss.in/">TEAM Foss.in</a>. The video features <a href="http://louiswu.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">louiswu</a>&nbsp;, <a href="http://atulchitnis.net/">Atul</a> and <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/shres">Shreyas</a>. check it out <a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=sfx8upiFlbY">here</a>.</p>
