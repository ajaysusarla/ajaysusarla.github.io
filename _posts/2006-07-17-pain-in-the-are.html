<p>After a long hiatus - and cocoon'ing myself from the world around me - am back.</p>
<p>I went thru some shit - which am too embarressed to speak about right now. But my sincere advice to all my friends reading this:<br />
DONT EAT JUNK FOOD - Too much of cheese specially.<br />
DONT DRINK TOO MUCH OF COLA BASED AERATED DRINKS<br />
EAT A LOTTT OF VEGETABLES.<br />
AND DRINK A LOT OF WATER.</p>
<p>EXCERCISE - RUN/WALK/CYCLE/JOG - DO WHATEVER - BUT REMEMBER TO EXCERCISE.</p>
<p>Cheerio.</p>
