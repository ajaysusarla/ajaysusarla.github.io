<p>Last week, I completed 34 years of existence on this wonderful planet. And I wanted to run 34K to celebrate. Although I set out to run the full 34K, the weather turned from bad to worse. What started of as an windy and not-so-cloudy morning transformed itself into a wet and rainy one. It was a really heavy downpour and I had to cut my run short to 20K (20.7KM to be precise in 1:55'11.5). But I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the run from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsea,_Victoria">Portsea</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Nepean">Fort Napean</a> and back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a beautiful path all the way to Fort Napean. And I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a good run. I did manage to run 34K a few days later though and it was the first time that I ran beyond 20K alone.</p>
<p>Hopefully this year turns out to be better than the last.</p>
