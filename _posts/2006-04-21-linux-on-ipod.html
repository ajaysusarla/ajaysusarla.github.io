<p>So i tried installing Linux on the iPod photo i got my hands on. I had seen this http://ipodlinux.org/Main_Page quite sometime ago. And when i did finally get an iPod - the first thing i did was try and install Linnux on it.<br />
It was fun. The kernel first and then the click wheel drivers, and then the encoders. It took me 8 hours straight, all night.<br />
I had a Linux kernel running - and i was flying high on my success, just when the mp3 decoder which i built and installed, screwed something up real bad, and the pod refused to boot. Sigh!! After a couple of days of trying to revive the kernel on the pod, i decided to give up. </p>
<p>I just restored the firmware back using the Mac machine i have right next to me at work, reminiscences of shreyas sitting next to me. </p>
<p>Hmm...</p>
