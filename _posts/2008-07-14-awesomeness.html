<p>I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773/">Kung Fu Panda</a> the other day, and it sure an hour and half of joyride and well written script and amazing one-liners. <br />The movie begins with this serious commentary about a legendary warrior - and you get to hear lines like "It is said that his enemies would go blind from over-exposure to pure awesomeness!"</p>
<p>It is more of lines like these, that kept me glued till the end. The lead character Po the Panda (voiced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Black">Jack Black</a>), is quite impressively done, And keeps one amused with its on-screen antics. Po, in every frame will inadvertently remind you Jack Black. </p>
<p>Check out the trailer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEgk9XsFCR0">here</a>.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you actually watch this movie, if you haven't already.<br />I am watching it again, for sure.&nbsp;</p>
