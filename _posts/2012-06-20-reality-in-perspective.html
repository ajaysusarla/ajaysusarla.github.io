<p>The latest xkcd <a href="http://xkcd.com/1071/" target="_blank">strip</a> is just plain incredible. To put reality into perspective so subtly requires immense talent and imagination.I hope <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism" target="_blank">creationists</a> everywhere realise that our planet isn't unique, and the probability that neither is the human race.</p>
<p>This is an exciting time indeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: I found an interesting video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D34YUpj3mIg">here</a>, that will aid us in visualising how tiny we actually are.</p>
