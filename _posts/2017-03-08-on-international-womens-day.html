<p>Yet another <a href="https://www.internationalwomensday.com/About">international women's day</a> is here. This is marked, world over, with events in various forms. From honouring women and recognizing their contribution at all levels, to acknowledging that there exists an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity">opportunity gap</a>, that we need to actively work towards reducing.<br />
Most of us will be reminded of this day with the forwards that we receive on various social and messaging platforms. And the day, and its significance is forgotten soon after.</p>
<p>There sure has been progress with women being given more opportunities, but a lot more needs to be done. While we need to address issues of <a href="https://www.wgea.gov.au/addressing-pay-equity/what-gender-pay-gap">Gender Pay Gap</a>[Australia specific data] and <a href="http://culturalorganizing.org/the-problem-with-that-equity-vs-equality-graphic/">Equity and Equality</a>. We need to talk about basic rights, female foeticide and sexual harassment, which are much more common than we think. We need to talk about these issues among ourselves and also in any public platform we have the opportunity to. We need to make people aware.</p>
<p>Today isn't the day to sit back and relax, instead today is when we look forward and work towards an inclusive and equal world. We should ensure that this day and every other day isn't a form of tokenism. Progress depends on what we do each and every day after all the hype has died down on a randomly chosen day in March.</p>
